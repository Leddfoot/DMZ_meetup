Styling is scoped to the component to avoid overwrites.

**The current methodology is actually OOCSS, not BEM, you have to either change all existing styles or change this sheet to oocss**

This is accomplished using CSS modules (**!index.js & index.css is an exception!**, just ignore it).  This is accomplished by adding a WhateverComponent.module.css alongside the WhateverComponent.js file. You must then import the styling into the component as such:

import styles from './WhateverComponent.module.css';

You can then style the component like so: <form className={styles.form}></form>.

Beware that some styles are inherited via a <Card> component or via props.

Use class Names that are BEM. The basics can be learned fast although it takes a while to learn some industry standard naming. Beware that some BEM classes already in use may be "wrong." I am still learning this myself and there is no one reviewing my code. I also don't know all of the standard naming conventions for blocks, elements and modifiers, only those that I have seen in various tuts. If you notice an BEM error, please let me know via Github. It's a very quick read here: https://getbem.com/naming/ . Example below.

NOTE: Most all BEM Examples use class naming with -- & __. For example: 

.site-search
.site-search__field
.site-search--full

However I am attempting to follow the variation below instead, because I repurpose a lot of styling from tuts I have worked on, many of them by maximilian schwarzm√ºller, and he uses the style below mostly. 

.site-search
.site-search input
.site-search .full
