#**Site Definition:**
DMZ Meeting Place or whatever title will be a site that players can use to meet other players in the same game that have matching needs, such as, server location, language (**communication is super important**, and when english, russian, and arabic speakers are grouped together, they have a disadvantage). Are they looking only for players with microphone?

Also, importantly, what missions are you working on? It sucks to get matched up with noobs that run off on their own and get killed and provoke massive AI agro. You spend your whole match reviving noobs and accomplish none of your missions.

But if three farsi speakers, working on the same missions are paired together, their efficiency is super high and team coherence is optimum.

#**Current Plans:**

#**Priority**
Speed is of essence, so instead of building full search matchup capability with backend etc., site will be rolled out first with users entering their information and the site will list all users that are currently seeking others, for 3 minutes. This is OK because the site is unknown and traffic in the beginning will be virtually none.

#**Planned Improvements**
As traffic builds, more features will be added. This is the current plan:
    ##Add version control
    ##**Prioritize Solid Testing**
    ##Allow Sorting and filtering of list of displayed users that are seeking other users
    ##Create Login backend so users can avoid guest user 
    ##Create a filtration system that allows users to search for very specific circumstances, ie: english speaker on European servers seeking only players on Junkyard missions
    ##This concept is useful for the gaming community, **not only in DMZ** so focus should be placed on **QUALITY,** scalability
    ##scalability in particular should early on consider multi language versions
